            <h1>About Fantasy Iditarod</h1>
            <p>Fantasy Iditarod is fantasy league for players to create a team of, what they believe to be, the best mushers. Each team gets to pick 5 mushers, and points are awarded based on each musher's position as they get to each checkpoint. The farther along a musher is, the more points they get. You can read more about the rules <a href="rules.php">here.</a></p>
            <p>The event only runs during the race with a registration period that opens 2 months prior to the race. If you missed the cutoff for the year - don't worry! You can still follow the race, and follow which mushers are getting the most points in the league.</p>
            <p>Fantasy Iditarod is free to join, and there are no prizes for the winners - other than the satisfaction, of course!</p>
            <h2>What is the Iditarod?</h2>
            <p>
        The Iditarod, also known as the “The Last Great Race,” is a sled dog race from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nome, Alaska. The race consists of mushers and a team of sled dogs racing over 950 miles across the Alaskan wilderness for around 8-15 days. The race began in 1973 to commemorate Alaska’s historical dog sled teams, which were a primary mode of transportation until the 1960s. </p>
