            <h2> Rules for Fantasy Iditarod </h2>
<p>The goal of the league is to pick a team of mushers that accumulates the most points over the race. After the last musher crosses the finish line, the user with the most points wins. Every user picks a team of five mushers. Their team must include <b>one woman, one rookie, and at most one past winner.</b></p> 

<p>Points are earned based on the order the mushers enter into each checkpoint. The first musher into a checkpoint gets as many points as there are mushers at the beginning of the race. Subsequent mushers get 1 point less than the previous musher in, and the last musher into a checkpoint gets 1 point. For example, in a race with 60 mushers, the first musher in will get 60 points, the second musher gets 59 points, and so on. If a musher scratches after the race begins, so there are only 59 mushers currently racing, the first musher into a checkpoint will still get 60 points, and the last musher will get 1.

<p>Additional points are given to first, second, and third place finishers. The first musher in gets an additional 300 points, second musher gets 200 points, and third musher gets 100 points. </p>

<p>5 of the checkpoints are also “dog checkpoints.” At these checkpoints, you get 1 additional point for every dog you have with you entering the checkpoint.</p>

<p></p>If a musher on your team scratches, you will still get the points they already earned, but will receive no additional points.
